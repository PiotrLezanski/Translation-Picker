# Translation-Picker

## Idea
Translation Picker is a project made by me for Content Develepment Team during internship at idealo.de in Berlin. It Was later connected with Python script and Flask to work as a inner tool for my colleagues. 

It was mainly used to help translators in managing different websides of idealo and download information about specific products listed on the side.
